| **Objective**      | **1**                                                                                                                                       | **2**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **3**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Research Question  | Student does not have a coherent research question. The question is either incomplete, non-existent or is poorly communicated.              | Student research question is concise, direct, and practical. Student can communicate their main findings in 1-2 sentences. Student potentially had to alter their course on the projects based on the problem and the data, these learnings are documented and articulated by the project. | Student powerfully communicated a compelling research question and student's data insights are particularly valuable and well-communicated.                                                                                                                             |
| Source Dataset     | Student did not source an appropriate or usable dataset. Student did not avoid datasets that are overused in student data science projects. | Student sourced a useful dataset that was not too complex to work with and that had enough usable features so as to provide insights relating to the research question. Data set was cleaned appropriately for the project.                                                                | Student went above and beyond to source data. Student may have successfully: cleaned particularly dirty data, scraped a dataset from a website, merged multiple datasets or generated particularly creative new features on a dataset that allowed for unique insights. |
| Notebook           | Student notebook is incomplete, messy, does not run from top to bottom.                                                                     | Student has a notebook that documents their data cleaning, exploration, and visualizations. Notebook runs successfully from top to bottom.                                                                                                                                                 | Student notebook is very clean and readable. Notebook runs from top to bottom and contains appropriate markdown and code comments.                                                                                                                                      |
| Two Visualizations | Student does not create at least two basic visualizations.                                                                                  | Student creates two explanatory visualizations that communicate insights from their dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                               | Student's visualizations are particularly polished and consumable. Viewers will correctly interpret the main data insight in seconds without reading supporting text.                                                                                                   |
| Blog Post          | Student does not write or publish a data storytelling blog post                                                                             | Student writes and publishes a data storytelling blog post that includes two visualizations and effectively communicates data insights. Blog post should be written for a non-technical audience.                                                                                          | Student blog post is particularly well written, compelling, and consumable by non-technical readers.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Portfolio          | Student does not link to blog post from portfolio.                                                                                          | Student links to their blog post from their portfolio site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Student links to their blog post from their portfolio site and also works to share their post on social media.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Presentation       | Student does not present or provide a recording of a presentation.                                                                          | Student gives a two minute presentation or records a two-minute presentation to their peers.                                                                                                                                                                                               | Student's two-minute presentation is well rehearsed, easy to understand and communicates main ideas within the two minute time limit.                                                                                                                                   |

## Deliverables

_The project has five parts. For each part, we've listed what's required to pass the Sprint Challenge, and what's recommended but not required._

### 1. Research Question
Required
- Describe your project in 280 characters or less.
- Choose one data visualization (static image or animated gif) from your blog post.
- [Annotate your visualization](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/making-538-plots/) so it’s understandable on its own, without reading your blog post.

Recommended
- Share your short project summary on Twitter or LinkedIn, and link to your blog post

### 2. Code
Required
- Create Python notebook(s) to wrangle, analyze, and visualize your data.
- Push your notebook(s) to your GitHub.

Recommended
- Keep it simple. Don’t use machine learning. (You’ll do this in future projects!)

### 1. Blog post

Required
- Choose your own topic and data.
- Write a blog post with at least two data visualizations, to communicate insights on your topic.
